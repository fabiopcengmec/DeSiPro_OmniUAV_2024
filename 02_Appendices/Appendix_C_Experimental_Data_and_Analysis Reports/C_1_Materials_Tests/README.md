# Appendix_C-1_Materials
This repository stores the dataset of materials to tensile and flexion tests.
The directory is separated into two, namely tensile tests and flexion tests.
Each directory has seven data sets, with ten to twelve experiments each, relating to six types of resins used in additive manufacturing processes. 
These data are useful for evaluating the mechanical behavior of these materials.
